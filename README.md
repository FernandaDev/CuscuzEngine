# Cuscuz Engine

This is a small project in c++ using SDL as the main library to create a small engine and possibly some 2D games.

I'm using TheCherno's C++ [project template](https://github.com/TheCherno/ProjectTemplate) to help with the inital project organization. 

[Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) is used to generate project files.
