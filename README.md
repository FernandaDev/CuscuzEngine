# 2D Game

This is a small project in c++ using SDL as the main library to create a 2D game.

I'm using a little quick-start [project template](https://github.com/TheCherno/ProjectTemplate) for C++ projects which utilise a Core/App project architecture. [Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) is used to generate project files.
